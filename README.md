# RedditPrediction
Predict the number of comments and upvotes to a post in Reddit.
## Instructions
### Data Note:
The data is currently stored in a database, and there is a CSV file in the dataset directory.
If you want to run the notebook without using the database, you may need to modify the code to read the data from the CSV file instead.
### Run the Jupyter Notebook:
First, open and run the file RedditDataBlogPrediction.ipynb.

!Notice again that data is in database, you can crawl data by running crawldata.ipynb and preprocessing.ipynb or modify code to use CSV file.
### Models:
After running the notebook, the models will be saved in the models directory.
### Run the Application:
Open a terminal and run the command:
```sh
     python app.py
```
You will then receive a link to access the user interface.
